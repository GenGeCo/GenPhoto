# GenPhoto

GenPhoto (formerly *PhotoHaul*) is a lightweight, free **Windows** application designed to clean up the chaos of photos and videos scattered across old phones, USB sticks, external drives, NAS folders and backups.

It scans your folders, safely detects duplicates and rebuilds a single clean library, organized by **Year → Month**, without altering image quality or metadata.

> **Note:** The project was originally released as *PhotoHaul*.  
> It has been renamed to **GenPhoto** to avoid confusion with unrelated existing projects.

## About the Rebranding

The name has been changed to avoid confusion with other unrelated tools and to build a clear, unique identity for the project.
